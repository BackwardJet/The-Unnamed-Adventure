# The-Unnamed-Adventure

This project is a text-based adventure game in Java. This application would run the most efficiently with the BlueJ IDE. To start the game, create an instance of class "Game" and call its "play" method. I am currently working on running it from the terminal

In this version, it has a few rooms and the ability for a player to walk between these rooms.
